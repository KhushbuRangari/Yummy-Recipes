Ingredients of Chicken Biryani

5 Servings
1 cup boiled basmati rice
1/2 teaspoon mint leaves
salt as required
2 teaspoon virgin olive oil
3 green cardamom
2 clove
2 onion
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 cup hung curd
2 tablespoon coriander leaves
water as required
1 tablespoon ghee
600 gm chicken
1 tablespoon garam masala powder
1 teaspoon saffron
1 tablespoon bay leaf
1 black cardamom
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
4 green chillies
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon red chilli powder
1/2 tablespoon ginger
2 drops kewra
1 tablespoon rose water

Step 1 Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies
To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.

Step 2 Saute the onions
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)

Step 3 Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes
Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.

Step 4 Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita
Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!

**********************************************                      paneer tikka              ***************************************
Certainly! Paneer tikka is a delicious Indian appetizer made with marinated paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and grilled or baked to perfection. Here's a simple recipe for making paneer tikka:

**Ingredients:**
- 250g paneer, cut into bite-sized cubes
- 1/2 cup thick yogurt
- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
- 1 tablespoon red chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon turmeric powder
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon cumin powder
- 1 tablespoon coriander powder
- 1 tablespoon chaat masala
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Salt, to taste
- Vegetables (bell peppers, onions, tomatoes), cut into chunks
- Skewers (wooden or metal)

**Instructions:**
1. In a mixing bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, chaat masala, lemon juice, oil, and salt. Mix well to make the marinade.
2. Add paneer cubes to the marinade. Gently coat the paneer with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour in the refrigerator. The longer it marinates, the more flavorful it will be.
3. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 20-30 minutes to prevent them from burning while grilling.
4. Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat.
5. Thread the marinated paneer cubes and vegetable chunks onto the skewers, alternating between paneer and veggies.
6. If grilling: Grease the grill grates with oil. Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until the paneer is slightly charred and cooked through.
7. If baking: Place the skewers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 15-20 minutes or until the paneer is cooked and has a slight char.
8. Once the paneer tikka is cooked, remove it from the grill or oven.
9. Serve the paneer tikka hot, garnished with a sprinkle of chaat masala and fresh lemon juice. You can also serve it with mint chutney or yogurt dip on the side.

**Tips:**
- You can customize the spice level according to your preference.
- Feel free to experiment with different vegetables, such as mushrooms or zucchini.
- If you don't have access to a grill or oven, you can also cook paneer tikka in a pan on the stovetop using a little oil.

Enjoy your flavorful and aromatic paneer tikka as an appetizer or a delicious snack!
